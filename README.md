# First object field:
Explains the concept of lexical scope when we have a object and selects calls functions to print a value
based on the scope.
See field #object.js

# Algorithm 1  practice Binary search.
Here we applied the best way look for the index of and specific element from and array.
if we used the common solution to find the index of the last element, we have to loop every element until get the last's index element.
So because of that case we should use other way to make that posible.
The binary search is based on search the element the next way:
1. you split the array in the middle and based on the element in the middle you look if the index you are looking for
is after that middle of before so you can rearch from there and find the element quicker than looping the elements one by one.
